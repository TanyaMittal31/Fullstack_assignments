    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
        JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
        typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
